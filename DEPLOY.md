# 🚀 Deploy Your Task Balancer App

## ✅ Current Status

Your app is deployed and running with:

- ✅ PostgreSQL database (Neon)
- ✅ Auto-deploy on push to main (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Serverless hosting (Vercel)

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

### `DATABASE_URL`

Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string. Should look like:

```
postgresql://neondb_owner:password@ep-xxx.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### `VERCEL_ORG_ID` & `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

Already configured in GitHub Secrets for auto-deploy.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- Use the **direct** connection URL (not pooled) for serverless environments
- Check that the database exists and is accessible

### Deployment Issues

- Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
- Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure latest code is pushed to `main` branch

## � Making Changes

1. Make your changes locally
2. Test with `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push to `main`
4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to Vercel

**Your app is live and auto-deploying!** 🎉
